# PSPGL-OpenGL-Shapes
GLUT advanced shapes implementation for the PSPGX library (OpenGL)
Important: This has been added to the original PSP-Ports repo: https://github.com/pspdev/psp-ports/pull/27#event-3236799307

## Shapes implemened:
- Sphere
- Torus
- Cone
- Disc

Create an issue if you would like the teapot too

Include directly the C file in your source where you need these shapes and use the classic OpenGL GLUT calls.
You may have in some cases to define the PI constant.

## Disclaimer
I hate trigonometry. I hate mathematics. Yet I need them to do OpenGL

Imagine this is originally made in 1993
